/// A client that caches connections for reuse.
///
/// The client maintains a cache of up to `max_idle` connections, evicting the least
/// recently used entry when the cache is full.
///
/// # Bound applies to cached entries, not live connections
///
/// `max_idle` bounds the number of connections held in the cache, not the number of
/// connections the client may have open at any one time. Concurrent requests whose
/// cached connection is absent (or currently checked out for another in-flight
/// request) each open a fresh socket; any surplus streams simply fail to re-enter
/// the cache on put-back once it is full. To bound concurrency — rather than idle
/// reuse — a caller must arrange a separate semaphore on top.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// # async fn request() {
/// use bitreq::{Client, RequestExt};
///
/// let client = Client::new(10); // Cache up to 10 idle connections
/// let response = bitreq::get("https://example.com")
///     .send_async_with_client(&client)
///     .await;
/// # }
