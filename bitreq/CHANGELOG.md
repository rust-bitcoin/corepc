# 0.2.0 - 2025-10-31

* Re-implement `json-using-serde` feature [#398](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/corepc/pull/398)
* Update MSRV to Rust `v1.75.0` [#405](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/corepc/pull/405/)

# 0.1.0 - 2025-10-22

* Fork `minreq`, strip it down, and import it into the `corepc` repo.
  Rename to `bitreq` while doing so.

I forked `minreq` from the master branch 3 months ago and did not grab
the commit hash when forking, at the time the released version was 2.13.4
